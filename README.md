# Driver Drowsiness Detection and Analysis

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to develop a reliable drowsiness detection device and database system for analyzing driver behavior. We used machine learning to identify patterns indicative of drowsiness in drivers, and the system allows users to store this information in a database for further analysis.
